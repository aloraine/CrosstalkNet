# EpiStroma-webapp a tool to analyze bi-partite and non-bipartite biological networks

### Running the app

Two commands are required for running the app. They should both be run from the main directory EpiStroma-webapp which contains the server.js file.

1. npm start
2. node server.js

The first command installs and updates all javascript dependencies in case they are missing.
The second command actually runs the server itself.
